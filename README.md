# DS105 Final Project

# What makes good music?

What makes good music? One's taste of music is a rather subjective matter: one's favourite music could very well be another's most hated song. It seems that music could be one of the worst topics for newbie data scientists to choose. But... we want to challenge ourselves, and see that if even something as abstract as music can be quantified using the prowess of knowledge in DS105. While music is an art, it can also be a science. While it will be naive for us to assume that music taste can be "solved", we believe that we can at least find some insights into the world of music, by simply applying basic data science principles. Let's dive in!

# Breakdown of our tools

Before we present our methodology, we will first present the tools (a logger needs to sharpen the saw before chopping down the trees). Our repository will consist of several parts, namely:
* ds

```python
name = 'name'
```

# Our sources of data

## YouTube API

## Genius
