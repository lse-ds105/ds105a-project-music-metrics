For eg:
Issue: Update graphs

2. On your own VSCode, create a new branch with the same name and enter that branch. 
Type the following into your terminal:
git checkout -b update-graphs

3. Do the edits necessary, save, then git add, commit and push. When pushing, follow instructions for what to type.

4. On GitHub, someone should compare the pull request, leave a comment and merge the request. After merging, delete the branch.
