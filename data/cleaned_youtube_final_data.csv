Then he gets to meet a  rap label which fires him he got shot defend their label from bad publicity. Eminem discover his rap skils ending up producing rap music like Doctor Dre and Eminem himself thinking he helps him with that. In the absolute entitlement and and cage of lies everyone makes good money because the CD of them all get respect for killer flows. The CD of 50 Cent says it all reading the true intentions. Get rich or die trying. It all about making much money at all costs. Celebrating a birthday then even have to reveal the truth that it a fat lie celebration of birthday that is not even real having a party drinking Barcadi. Everything about this rap track is selling idea of lying about everything for the sake getting rich. The truth is that no Gangster rapper knows about life they all get ideas of having sex all day and then get involved in the hate game where envy gets activated so all Ganster Rappers end up in distracks burying each other causing more madness and acts of violence sometimes with the intention to murder each other with guns blasting each other in a so called drive by. Every single time it get really really serious yet every rapper being black stating that the music is for black people only. Never realizing that this is in fact pride and entitlement being a true racist idea yet all black people think racism is a system only from KKK and nazis white people who made slavery their right. And even when the black community gets supported by some white police officers like Lil wayne testifys himself understanding their is actually some people not hating black people. The whole problem is that we all go to school in compition of each other to always work and study and discuss vote and fight for our rights of freedom of saying anything we want to say. Man most people don't stop this endless circle of death. We have Wikipedia the internet of Total discovery of the map of the earth. Yet because everyone thinks he can say whatever he wants we constantly ignore it. We sell people to porn industry and only fans we play games all day long work in constant hurry even after inventing more and more machines to make life easier. Everyone celebrates movies and stories. Yet we let Artificial Intelligence modify every photo stating earth is flat and atomic bombs don't even exist.

My parents didn’t even know what the song was talking about either because they didn’t understand English that much, and also my dad would blast some shit like this in his truck with the windows open and he still does it to this day, he would play the songs or raps he likes he gets them from the radio or tik tok and he would blast it loud and people would stare at us like what kind of cringe shit are you listening to?And my dad would just jam out and hum to the music and the songs were in English and he didn’t understand shit of what the songs were singing about and he would just hum😂 he thought blasting music loud made him look cool because he saw people blasting music from their car and asked me why are they blasting loud music? and I would say IDK, so anyway back to the story, so my mom one day signed up for English classes to improve her English and one day when we were getting out of the 99¢ store and got on the car heading home, the song pops up and then my mom switched the radio and she was like “no, this kinda music isn’t appropriate for your age” and I was like what? You didn’t even care about all those times that song came up and she said no, no more music like this. I didn’t feel to bad because I always go with my dad whenever we’re on the road and whenever this song pops up and would just jam out and so did I. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh good times, 😞 sad those good times are now long time memories but we will always cherish them', 'I miss the old time 😢', 'Feb 2024 anyone?']"

When he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.”\n\n2 He said to them, “When you pray, say:\n\n“‘Father,[a]\nhallowed be your name,\nyour kingdom come.[b]\n3 Give us each day our daily bread.\n4 Forgive us our sins,\n    for we also forgive everyone who sins against us.[c]\nAnd lead us not into temptation.[d]’”\n\n5 Then Jesus said to them, “Suppose you have a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread; 6 a friend of mine on a journey has come to me, and I have no food to offer him.’ 7 And suppose the one inside answers, ‘Don’t bother me. The door is already locked, and my children and I are in bed. I can’t get up and give you anything.’ 8 I tell you, even though he will not get up and give you the bread because of friendship, yet because of your shameless audacity[e] he will surely get up and give you as much as you need.\n\n9 “So I say to you: Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. 10 For everyone who asks receives; the one who seeks finds; and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened.\n\n11 “Which of you fathers, if your son asks for[f] a fish, will give him a snake instead? 12 Or if he asks for an egg, will give him a scorpion? 13 If you then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”', '❤❤❤Psalm 27\nKing James Version\n27 The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?\n\n2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.\n\n3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.\n\n4 One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his temple.\n\n5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.\n\n6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord.\n\n7 Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.\n\n8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek.\n\n9 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.\n\n10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up.\n\n11 Teach me thy way, O Lord, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.\n\n12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.\n\n13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.\n\n14 Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the Lord.', '❤❤❤Yeshua', '❤❤❤']"

Under their regime, the ownership of pets is considered an act of blasphemy, as they believe that animals are meant to serve humans and not to be cherished as companions.\r\n\r\nIn this society, the officials have twisted science to fit their theological narrative, claiming that the natural order dictates that animals should be subservient to humans, and any form of emotional attachment to them is a defiance of this order. They have propagated the idea that pet ownership leads to a deviation from the divine path, causing chaos and disrupting the balance of the universe.\r\n\r\nTo enforce this decree, the corrupt officials deploy a group of enforcers known as the ""Divine Order Guardians,"" who are tasked with confiscating and eliminating any pets found in the possession of citizens. These guardians are revered as the chosen enforcers of the divine will, and they use pseudo-scientific justifications to justify their draconian actions.\r\n\r\nHowever, a clandestine group of scientists and theologians, who have preserved the true knowledge of the natural world, secretly work to debunk the officials\' distorted interpretations of science and theology. They strive to educate the populace about the true interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of compassion and empathy, both scientifically and spiritually.\r\n\r\nAmidst this oppressive regime, a forbidden underground movement emerges, advocating for the rights of animals and the freedom to form meaningful bonds with them.
