A few days before her next birthday she committed suicide, and my son and i found her. He was 12. The last several years have been the hardest of our lives, but we've persevered. We've limped along, but we've made it so far. My son is in college and i am now with a woman who is wonderful and able to heal us both. \n\nThe pain, the struggle my son and i feel will never be over. His mother will not be there to congratulate him on his graduation, or to kiss his cheek when he gets married, or whisper sweet words to his babies. We will have to make do with what she might have said, or done. She would have been a light on his world, and mine.\n\nPlease, if you feel you can't go on, keep going. Just walk on. If you feel you can't walk another mile, please find a way to crawl. Crawl until you're able to walk again. Someday the sun will shine on you again. If you go, the pain you will leave behind will eclipse the good you did, the sweet memories you could have left. Don't leave. Just hang on. I promise it'll get better. \n\nWe love you.
