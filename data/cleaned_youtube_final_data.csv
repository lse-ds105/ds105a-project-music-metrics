Because of the oxygen units, the noise was very loud and he was wearing a large heavy duty mask.\n  I encouraged him not to speak as it was exhausting for him nor could i understand his words. \n Therfore, I began to sing, ""In case you didnt know"", which i had sang to him a multitude of times over the years, which was truly the song i would have loved to hear him sing to me.  Well...As I sang the words my beloved David began to sing the words!!!!  \nI started to choke up but continued to sing.  \nThe three of us david, myself and the angel nurse...began to cry but we sang as long as his breathe allowed.  \nThis song is forever in my heart and holds a most special memory and is being recorded in my book, ""Breathless.""

Under their regime, the ownership of pets is considered an act of blasphemy, as they believe that animals are meant to serve humans and not to be cherished as companions.\r\n\r\nIn this society, the officials have twisted science to fit their theological narrative, claiming that the natural order dictates that animals should be subservient to humans, and any form of emotional attachment to them is a defiance of this order. They have propagated the idea that pet ownership leads to a deviation from the divine path, causing chaos and disrupting the balance of the universe.\r\n\r\nTo enforce this decree, the corrupt officials deploy a group of enforcers known as the ""Divine Order Guardians,"" who are tasked with confiscating and eliminating any pets found in the possession of citizens. These guardians are revered as the chosen enforcers of the divine will, and they use pseudo-scientific justifications to justify their draconian actions.\r\n\r\nHowever, a clandestine group of scientists and theologians, who have preserved the true knowledge of the natural world, secretly work to debunk the officials\' distorted interpretations of science and theology. They strive to educate the populace about the true interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of compassion and empathy, both scientifically and spiritually.\r\n\r\nAmidst this oppressive regime, a forbidden underground movement emerges, advocating for the rights of animals and the freedom to form meaningful bonds with them.

Me encanta', ""@Ruisu-San originally posted this analysis on @ashlenamusic, and it's quite brilliant. A must-read for any fans (or even non-fans!) of the song or the band:\r\n\r\n“Sick” is a song about how “sickening” having a superficial, mundane life with no purpose can be.\r\nThe girls are just playing a role in this video of 3 people that are living and loving their mundane lives.\r\nFor example:\r\n“Help me now 'cause I only debase\r\nWhen I see the problem\r\nStaring straight at my face\r\nI wanna kiss it, lick it\r\nMake it my own\r\nWanna taint the color\r\n'Til it's faded and gone”\r\nMeaning: This is about the people that every time they have a problem they only degrade it and don’t confront the issues, they just pretend that nothing is happening. \r\n\r\n“Bleeding just to feel alive\r\nI'm rotting in my place\r\nLife is nothing more than passing time\r\n[Chorus]\r\nGive me violence\r\nKill the silence\r\n'Til it makes me feel\r\n'Til it makes me feel\r\n'Til it makes me feel\r\nSick!”\r\nMeaning: This is about the people that spend their lives focused on their phones or TV, watching all the violence, noise and chaos of the social media, TV shows, news and so on.\r\n\r\n“I wanna make mistakes and live in regret\r\nDon't wanna give, just take\r\nGet out of my head\r\nAnd if I break it, fake it\r\nDon't carе what comes next\r\nIf therе's a price to pay\r\nI'll deal with it when I'm dead”\r\nMeaning: This is about the selfishness of these  people, normally this people want more, they want to be entertained, but they don’t offer anything to anybody. These people don’t care about the consequences of their actions and they just prefer to be fake than being honest.\r\n\r\n“Leave me ruined\r\nShow me that I'm human\r\n'Til it makes me feel\r\n'Til it makes me feel\r\n'Til it makes me feel\r\nSick!”\r\nMeaning: This is about these people knowing that their mundane life is going to leave them ruined and “show me that I’m human” means show me human behavior and show me human imperfection, because that’s all there is nowadays in social media and TV.\r\n\r\nGuys, these girls are very clever to write, they don’t write dumb music. \r\nPay attention to Paulina’s cute dance when they are singing “Give me violence”, “Kill the silence”.\r\nThis has a meaning, they are playing the role of the people that actually enjoy this mundane life, how they see all this TV and social media violence and chaos as something cute and fun.\r\n\r\nAlso the fly has a meaning, that fly is actually representing how annoying these mundane people are, they are everywhere bugging you.\r\n\r\nThe message of this song is that you should live your life to the fullest with a purpose, otherwise you will feel sick!.
