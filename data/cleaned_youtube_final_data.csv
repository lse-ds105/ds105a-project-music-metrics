Then he gets to meet a  rap label which fires him he got shot defend their label from bad publicity. Eminem discover his rap skils ending up producing rap music like Doctor Dre and Eminem himself thinking he helps him with that. In the absolute entitlement and and cage of lies everyone makes good money because the CD of them all get respect for killer flows. The CD of 50 Cent says it all reading the true intentions. Get rich or die trying. It all about making much money at all costs. Celebrating a birthday then even have to reveal the truth that it a fat lie celebration of birthday that is not even real having a party drinking Barcadi. Everything about this rap track is selling idea of lying about everything for the sake getting rich. The truth is that no Gangster rapper knows about life they all get ideas of having sex all day and then get involved in the hate game where envy gets activated so all Ganster Rappers end up in distracks burying each other causing more madness and acts of violence sometimes with the intention to murder each other with guns blasting each other in a so called drive by. Every single time it get really really serious yet every rapper being black stating that the music is for black people only. Never realizing that this is in fact pride and entitlement being a true racist idea yet all black people think racism is a system only from KKK and nazis white people who made slavery their right. And even when the black community gets supported by some white police officers like Lil wayne testifys himself understanding their is actually some people not hating black people. The whole problem is that we all go to school in compition of each other to always work and study and discuss vote and fight for our rights of freedom of saying anything we want to say. Man most people don't stop this endless circle of death. We have Wikipedia the internet of Total discovery of the map of the earth. Yet because everyone thinks he can say whatever he wants we constantly ignore it. We sell people to porn industry and only fans we play games all day long work in constant hurry even after inventing more and more machines to make life easier. Everyone celebrates movies and stories. Yet we let Artificial Intelligence modify every photo stating earth is flat and atomic bombs don't even exist.

Loved it!!!', 'Mikey Cyrus copied this a little for her song Fliwers', 'In an alternate world where corrupt officials hold absolute power, they have made pet ownership illegal, citing it as a violation of the divine order. Under their regime, the ownership of pets is considered an act of blasphemy, as they believe that animals are meant to serve humans and not to be cherished as companions.\r\n\r\nIn this society, the officials have twisted science to fit their theological narrative, claiming that the natural order dictates that animals should be subservient to humans, and any form of emotional attachment to them is a defiance of this order. They have propagated the idea that pet ownership leads to a deviation from the divine path, causing chaos and disrupting the balance of the universe.\r\n\r\nTo enforce this decree, the corrupt officials deploy a group of enforcers known as the ""Divine Order Guardians,"" who are tasked with confiscating and eliminating any pets found in the possession of citizens. These guardians are revered as the chosen enforcers of the divine will, and they use pseudo-scientific justifications to justify their draconian actions.\r\n\r\nHowever, a clandestine group of scientists and theologians, who have preserved the true knowledge of the natural world, secretly work to debunk the officials\' distorted interpretations of science and theology. They strive to educate the populace about the true interconnectedness of all living beings and the importance of compassion and empathy, both scientifically and spiritually.\r\n\r\nAmidst this oppressive regime, a forbidden underground movement emerges, advocating for the rights of animals and the freedom to form meaningful bonds with them. As the struggle between the corrupt officials and the clandestine group intensifies, the very fabric of their society is tested, challenging the boundaries of science, theology, and the human spirit.', 'I always love this song I just see the video I love it even more now Thank you for bringing me to happy tears', 'Oh interracial love, so beautiful.', '401', 'For Samantha wherever you are...
